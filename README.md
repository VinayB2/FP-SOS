## Introduction

FP-SOS is a smart surveillance solution designed for streetlight poles equipped with ESP32-CAM modules and SOS buttons. It provides real-time video streaming, dynamic alert management, and a responsive web interface for efficient monitoring. When an SOS button is pressed, an alert is triggered, and the associated live camera feed is highlighted for prompt action. 

This project aims to enhance public safety by enabling efficient monitoring and quick response to emergency situations.

## Features

- **Surveillance Grid**: View live feeds from all cameras in a grid format with status indicators.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly locate a specific pole's camera feed by entering its unique Pole ID.
- **SOS Alert Management**: Highlight and prioritize live feeds from poles with active SOS alerts.
- **Custom Camera View**: View detailed live video of a specific pole by selecting its Pole ID.
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Efficient WebSocket integration ensures real-time updates.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes for optimal usability.
- **Authentication**: Basic security layer to restrict unauthorized access within a local network.

## Usage

1. **Surveillance Grid**:
   - Navigate to the Surveillance Grid page to view live feeds from all connected cameras.

2. **Search by Pole ID**:
   - Use the search bar to filter and view the live feed of a specific pole by its unique Pole ID.

3. **SOS Alerts**:
   - When an SOS button is pressed, the corresponding live feed appears on the Alerts Page for 10 minutes.
   - The stream is automatically recorded for review.

4. **Custom Camera View**:
   - Enter a Pole ID to access the live feed of a specific camera.
